## Presentation

- (2 points) Little bit of history about the language
- (3 points) class of problems for which the language is particularly well suited for, get your class excited about what they are about to learn. 
- What is the language really good at, it’s strength
- What is the language not so good at, it’s weaknesses
- existing sites on the web, applications that use this tool
- (5 points) Basic Info – For example:
- Is your language compiled or interpreted
- Talk about the Variables of the language:
- Case sensitive
- Static/dynamic
- Strong type casting/weak type casting
- Do variables need to be declared
- Strong typing
- Quickly go through the 2 example program handouts that you created and handed out to the students.
- Does it easily integrate with other languages
- Is it getting more popular or less popular? If less what language is replacing it. If more, what language is it replacing?

- (20 Points) Technical Presentation - During the presentation: speak clearly, speak loud enough for the students in the back row to hear, walk around during the student hands-on exercises to make sure that they are doing the work and check to see if they need help, don’t read off of the slides – use them as a guide, etc.
  
- (65 points) Presentation Hands-On Portion – THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD SPEND 75%-80% of your presentation time. Demonstrate the strengths of the language.  Spend a large amount of time showing the strengths of the language through actual programs, explain how they work, let the students give it a try after each example by asking them to do something. Look on D2L under the content tab, there is a folder entitled Presentation guide that gives a lot of detail about your language and what you want to make sure to cover.

- (5 Points) – Create an appropriate in class assignment for college juniors; that the student will work on. You must have a working solution

## General Info:

- keep examples small, do not give large examples because if a student(s) falls behind it is hard to catch up
- let students start by doing solving a problem with a for or while loop just to get used to the language syntax and learn how to compile and run it
- try to show as many capabilities of a language as possible, meaning you do not need to show them one capability 10 times
- it is best to put pictures in your slides showing students where to click vs paragraphs of words on the slides
- do a small example first of a capability, then ask students to try their own example
- ever once in a while make slightly larger problems for the students where solution will involving using 3/4 new capabilities they just learned. For example from Wednesday presentation a problem that involves: textbox, label, listbox, button
- let students start by doing something with a for or while loop just to get used to the language syntax and learn how to compile and run it
- try to show as many capabilities of a language as possible, meaning you do not need to show them one capability 10 times
